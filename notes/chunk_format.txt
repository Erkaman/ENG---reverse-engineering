"Failed to load ambient sound id" in the exe! maybe it is related to AMPC(ambient pack!)


Dword after TEXT means something. Length, perhaps?

also, seems like TNOF is always 0x800 long. 

and we read 2bytes at a piece, four times every iteration. and there
are 0x800 iterations. 


THGL,
reading, it runs 9 iterations. 9 can be found in hex right after length(?)

each iteration we do:
* read 4 ones. in other words read four bytes
* read one dword.
* read one dword
* read one dword.
